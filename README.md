Task A
Processes in the mechanical part (example in Figure 3.4) of inertial accelerometers used in automation systems: under the conditions of linear properties of the elastic and dissipative elements, the differential equation and the initial conditions of the relative motion of the inertial element of such an accelerometer in the general case have the following form:

Where m is the mass of the inertial element; Î² and c are characteristics of dissipative and elastic elements; x is a coordinate that determines the position of the inertial element relative to the undeformed elastic element; u is the law of motion of the measured object.
